## Fix My Inputs

This is a Chrome / Chromium extension that re-enables cut / copy / paste / contextmenu / drag / drop
events in any web page where the website author has decided he/she knows better than you and you 
apparently have no want / need for that functionality to work.

This extension also re-enables disabled mousedown / selectstart events that publishers sometimes use
to try to prevent selection and pilfering of their online content; a futile thing to do with public HMTL content.


To be fair I do completely get why web devs and the companies they work for go down the route of 
disabling this stuff but at the same time find it annoying and downright counter productive from
time to time so this is why Fix My Inputs exists.

If this drives you mad too and you want an unobtrusive way of re-enabling these disabled events in the
web pages you read then this is the extension for you. The Options page includes 'whitelist' functionality
and any domains added in here will be completely ignored by the extension.

Feel free to read the code here to satisfy yourself that the JS and HTML in this extension won't start WW3
or cause some other unsavoury disaster.
